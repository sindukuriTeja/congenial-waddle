                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>PestiVid is an innovative Web3 demonstration platform designed to bring transparency and trust to the agricultural supply chain. It leverages blockchain-simulated transactions, decentralized video storage (IPFS) and a suite of sophisticated AI tools to create a secure ecosystem for farmers, buyers and investors. Farmers record immutable video evidence of their crops and practices (Proof of-Practice). Buyers gain access to verified information, enabling confident purchasing. Investors discover and fund agricultural projects with enhanced operational visibility. The platform integrates flexible user authentication  and secure messaging. Its core innovation lies in its AI capabilities which include a multi-stage plant disease identification system utilizing CLIP and Deepseek models for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendation and an advanced agricultural chatbot (AgriBot) powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using a Deepseek model to provide context-aware, reliable advice. PestiVid addresses information asymmetry and market access challenges, fostering a more equitable and sustainable agricultural marketplace.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
                <section id="section1-1">
                    <h3>1.1 Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>The traditional agricultural supply chain often suffers from a critical lack of transparency, making it difficult for buyers to verify claims about product origin, quality, and farming practices. This information asymmetry leads to reduced consumer trust and unfair pricing for farmers who employ sustainable or premium methods. Investors also face significant challenges in identifying and tracking legitimate agricultural projects, which increases their financial risk.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, smallholder farmers frequently lack direct access to broader markets, efficient funding mechanisms and timely expert agricultural advice. PestiVid aims to solve these problems by creating a Web3 enabled platform that enhances transparency through video-verified proof, builds trust using decentralized data principles, provides farmers with direct market access and empowers them with state of the art AI driven support tools.</p>

                    <h3>1.2 Project Scope & Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The scope of this PestiVid demo is to build a functional proof-of-concept that showcases the potential of a transparent, Web3-based agricultural ecosystem. The key objectives are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Develop a multi-role platform</b> for Farmers, Buyers, and Investors with distinct, role-based functionalities.</li>
                        <li><b>Implement "Proof-of-Practice"</b> by allowing farmers to record video, calculate a file hash (SHA256), and upload it to decentralized storage (.</li>
                        <li><b>Create a transparent marketplace (AgriSell)</b> where produce is listed with verifiable video evidence, and buyers can perform simulated purchases.</li>
                        <li><b>Build an investment module</b> where farmers can request project funding and investors can browse opportunities and simulate investments.</li>
                        <li><b>Integrate advanced AI tools</b> for practical farmer support, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A multi-model AI pipeline for plant disease analysis, using a CLIP model for initial identification and a Deepseek model for detailed treatment recommendations.</li>
                                <li>An advanced AgriBot chatbot using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)framework with a Deepseek model to ensure responses are accurate and grounded in a specific knowledge base.</li>

                <p>A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial for a multi-faceted application like PestiVid. The conceptual testing plan includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Unit Testing:</b> Testing individual functions and components in isolation (e.g., verifying the calculateFileHash function, testing form validation logic).</li>
                    <li><b>Integration Testing:</b> Verifying the interactions between different modules, such as ensuring a video uploaded via the PestiVid module correctly appears as an option in the Sell module. This also includes testing the integration with the CLIP and Deepseek APIs to ensure requests and responses are handled correctly.</li>
                    <li><b>End-to-End (E2E) Testing:</b> Simulating full user journeys, such as a farmer registering, uploading a video, listing it for sale, and a buyer logging in and simulating a purchase.</li>

                    <h3>8.1 Project Achievements</h3>
                    <p>The PestiVid project successfully demonstrates a powerful proof-of-concept for a transparent, Web3-enabled agricultural platform. It achieves its primary goal of integrating decentralized identity, immutable video storage, and advanced AI into a cohesive application. A key achievement is the implementation of a sophisticated, multi-model AI pipeline, using CLIP and Deepseek models for plant analysis and a RAG-based Deepseek model for the AgriBot. This showcases a significant step beyond generic AI integration, proving the viability of the "Proof-of-Practice" concept as a foundation for building trust.</p>
